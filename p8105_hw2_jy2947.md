Problem 1
---------

The following code chunk reads the data and do some cleaning.

``` r
data_read = read.csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
nyc_transit = select(data_read, line:vending, ada, -exit_only) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry,"YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
names(nyc_transit)
```

    ##  [1] "line"              "station_name"      "station_latitude" 
    ##  [4] "station_longitude" "route1"            "route2"           
    ##  [7] "route3"            "route4"            "route5"           
    ## [10] "route6"            "route7"            "route8"           
    ## [13] "route9"            "route10"           "route11"          
    ## [16] "entrance_type"     "entry"             "vending"          
    ## [19] "ada"

The above code chunk retained variables about the station and discarded the variables about the entrances of the station. It also changed the value of `entry` variable into logical value. The dimension of the dataset is 1868 rows and 19 columns.

Each observation in the dataset is a subway station entrances/exits in NYC, the variables describe stations name of the entrance/exit, the routes that run through it, the latitude and logitude of the station and ways to enter each station, whether the entrance/exit has a vending allow entrance, and ADA compliance.

The dataset is not really tidy enough. The `route` variable needs to be combined in some way.

``` r
nrow(distinct(nyc_transit, station_name, line))
```

    ## [1] 465

``` r
sum(nyc_transit$ada)
```

    ## [1] 468

``` r
vending_proportion = 100 * nrow(filter(nyc_transit, vending == "NO"))/nrow(nyc_transit)
```

The output shows that there are 465 distinct stations. 468 stations are ADA compliant. 9.8% of the entrance/exits is not vending allowed.

``` r
mtw = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", 
                 sheet = 1, range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(date))
mtw$sports_balls = round(mtw$sports_balls, digits = 0)
mtw$sports_balls = as.integer(mtw$sports_balls)
prcpt17 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",
                     sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
                     skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(month), !is.na(total)) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)
  
prcpt16 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",
                     sheet = "2016 Precipitation",
                     skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    filter(!is.na(total), !is.na(month)) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2016)
prcpt = full_join(prcpt16, prcpt17, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name) %>% 
  rename(total_2016 = total.x, total_2017 = total.y)
mtw2016 = filter(mtw, year == 2016) 
```

The trash wheel dataset has 215 observations. The key variable is `dumpster`, which identifies a certain dumpster.
The precipitation dataset has 12 observations. the total precipitation in 2017 is 29.93. The median number of sports balls in 2016 is 26.
